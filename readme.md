Farmec Web Application v2: A Modern, Scalable, and Secure Platform

Overview

Farmec Web Application v2 marks a significant evolution, transforming the platform with a robust Go backend powered by the Gin framework, a dynamic React.js frontend, and a foundation built on cutting-edge cloud technologies. This re-architecture delivers enhanced performance, scalability, and a more seamless user experience.

Technology Stack

Backend: Go (Golang): Provides a high-performance, concurrent, and memory-efficient foundation for the API server. Gin Web Framework: Streamlines API development with its elegant routing, middleware, and templating capabilities. Frontend: React.js: Enables the creation of rich, interactive user interfaces with its component-based architecture. Cloudfront Distribution: Leverages Amazon's content delivery network (CDN) for global low-latency content delivery and improved frontend performance. Authentication: Firebase Authentication: Secure and robust user authentication and management service provided by Google. Infrastructure: Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service for reliable and scalable data storage. Amazon EC2: Virtual servers for flexible deployment of the Go backend. Amazon Nginx: High-performance web server for load balancing and reverse proxying. Amazon VPC: Isolated and secure virtual network environment for your application. Terraform: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool for consistent and automated provisioning of cloud resources. Transition from Django

The shift from Django to Go and React.js offers several advantages:

Performance: Go's concurrency model and efficiency excel in handling high volumes of requests, ensuring a snappy API experience. Modern Frontend Development: React.js provides a powerful framework for building highly interactive and responsive web interfaces. Cloud-Native Focus: Designed for seamless integration with cloud services, enhancing scalability and operational ease.
